            <h4 class="heading">Description</h4>
            <p class="Description">While most prefer steak cooked over a fire or a grill, when weather and circumstances don't allow, a reverse sear steak is the next best thing. Easy and perfect every time! Juicy and flavorful.</p>
            <h4 class="heading">Ingredients</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>4 (1 1/2 inch thick) New York Strip steaks</li>
                <li>4 Tablespoon butter</li>
                <li>Your preferred seasoning. We use Steak and Chop</li>
            </ul>
            <h4 class="heading">Steps</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Put the seasoned steak in a low oven and let it cook slowly until it reaches your desired internal temperature. Use a thermometer probe to check the internal temperature for doneness. This could take up to an hour.</li>
                <li>Sear the steak in a cast iron, carbon steel, or heavy stainless steel pan when smoking hot. It probably needs no more than a minute on each side.</li>
                <li>Baste the steak with butter until the steak has a crisp, dark exterior</li>
            </ol>
